# Monkey Zig

This project is a follow along of the books Writing an Interpreter in Go and Writing a Compiler in Go but in Zig. The follow along using Go is here at [gh/hasanhaja/monkey-go](https://github.com/hasanhaja/monkey-go). I'm using this as an opportunity to learn about how programming languages are built and also a little bit of how Zig works.
